## About

Are you tired of swapping armor while exploring the nether because those pesky piglins don't approve of your outfit?

Are you angry that the species so thirsty for gold somehow isn't satisfied with golden armor trims?

Me too, so I fixed it. With this mod piglins will treat players who wear gold trimmed armor like players who are wearing regular golden armor, thus pacifying them.  If gold isn't your thing however, you can track down the Snout Armor Trim in a Ruined Bastion and it should appease piglins all the same.
