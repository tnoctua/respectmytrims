# Respect My Trims

### About

Are you tired of swapping armor while exploring the nether because those pesky piglins don't approve of your outfit?

Are you angry that the species so thirsty for gold somehow isn't satisfied with golden armor trims?

Me too, so I fixed it. With this mod piglins will treat players who wear gold trimmed armor like players who are wearing regular golden armor, thus pacifying them.
